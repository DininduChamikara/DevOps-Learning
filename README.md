## Why DevOps?
* Waterfall Model - Development goes to next stage once the previous stage completed. 
* It cannot go back like waterfall.

### Disadvantages of waterfall model
* High risk and uncertainty.
* Not good for complex and object-oriented projects.
* Not suitable for requirement changes.
* No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
* It is very difficult to go back.


### What is Agile Methodology?
* A practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the SDLF.

* The main limitation in Agile Methodology even if the development process is agile, still the Deployment process is linear.
